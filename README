### Matlab implementation of 1NN-DTW classifier ###

1-nearest neighbour with dynamic time warping (1NN-DTW) classifier is considered a strong baseline for time series classification
task. However, Matlab does not provide a straighforward implementation of this classifier. 

This implementation is useful for practitioners of time series classification that prefer Matlab as programming language and
want a train their models using this classifier.


For an example just run --> Main.m
